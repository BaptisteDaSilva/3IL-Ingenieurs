		"Texte": "The apprentice engineer alternates periods in the company and within the school. Each mission in a company is close to a field of teaching that it can validate. If the pace of study is different from that of a student in formal education, the diploma awarded at the end of the course is the same. He is qualified by the Commission of the Titles of Engineer and confers a rank Master. TOEIC with 785 points minimum and must achieve a mandatory international mobility. The latter is designed to take into account the professional rhythm imposed on the apprentice. This obligation is provided for under the apprenticeship contract signed at the beginning of the course. The educational project is similar to that of the initial training. The program followed at the school is the same as the student engineers in classical training. The number of hours and credits allocated to each is different for the pace of school \/ business alternation. The validation of the materials follows the same procedures. The options of specialization to choose for the 3rd year are accessible to all the apprentices."
